# Student pipeline workspace

This is the starting point for your implementation. The platform supplies the
services, dependencies, source data, configuration, connection helpers, and
simple stage templates. Your team supplies the data engineering.

Read these documents in order:

1. `../assignment/getting-started.md`
2. `../assignment/brief.md`
3. `../assignment/plain-language-guide.md`
4. `../assignment/quantum-data-primer.md`
5. `../assignment/data-sources.md`
6. [Parquet in this assignment](../assignment/plain-language-guide.md#parquet-in-this-assignment)
7. `../assignment/silver-tables.md`
8. `../assignment/required-ml-tables.md`
9. `../assignment/part-2-ai-ml.md`
10. `../assignment/rubric.md`

The starter deliberately does not contain domain transformations, target
business tables, feature builders, or fitted models. `make check` verifies
connections, `make inventory` lists the three Bronze objects, and `make test`
checks low-level utilities. `make run` and `make train` stop at separate
unimplemented boundaries; replace both with your orchestrated stages.

`formats.py` provides representation-level readers for the supplied Stim `b8`
and `01` files. It does not decide how parity measurements, detector events,
shots, or decoder outputs should be modeled; those decisions remain part of
the assignment.

`ml.py` provides bit unpacking, course split assignment, the documented model
inputs, partition loading, and weighted LER. It does not select models, perform
training, or interpret results. Those remain required Part II work.

Generated data, reports, credentials, and notebook outputs should not be
committed to version control. Write required run evidence and outputs under the
`results/part1/` and `results/part2/` layout described in the brief.

The AI/ML stage is a downstream consumer check. A particular model score or an
improvement over a supplied decoder is not part of the grade.
